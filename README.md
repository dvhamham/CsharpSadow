## How to use it.

###### Set shadow to your windows form without border style by this class.
1. To implement this class, create new class in your project then copy all the code off class **DropShadow.cs** and past it into your class.
2. Then you need to implement this class `On initialize`.
```csharp
(new Core.DropShadow()).ApplyShadows(this);
 ```
